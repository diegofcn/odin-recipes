    <h2>Why Fajita Veggies?</h2>
    <p>They are crisp, tender, slightly caramelized and have that perfect touch of oregano flavor. So good!</p>
    <p>But the best part about fajita veggies is how versatile they are. You can put them front and center of a build-your-own fajita spread, add them to burrito bowls, or pile them in tacos.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large green bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt, pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the tops and bottoms off of the bell peppers, cut in half, remove the seeds, and then slice into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Slice the onion into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Add the sliced bell peppers and onion, and saute for 7-10 minutes, or until the veggies have softened and are starting to caramelize.</li>
        <li>When the fajita veggies are almost done, add the oregano, salt, and pepper, then stir for another minute.</li>
    </ol>
